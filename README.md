## About the project:
For the front-end I used react framwork.
For the back-end I used Node.js with express.
For the DataBase I used Google-firebase.

The live coding share a socket connection through the back-end using socket.io.

The requests for the data from the DB is made from the front and Api.js file.

Hope you will find it useful!
